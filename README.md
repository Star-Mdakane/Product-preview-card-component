## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
The background on the mobile view makes it difficult to adjust the screen size. I wanted to use grid auto or flex basis and grow on the container but the background is limiting me so I jusp otped to use responsive units were applicable
- See hover and focus states for interactive elements
I only used hover state for the button

### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```

If you want more help with writing markdown, we'd recommend checking out [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to learn more.

### Continued development

Using the newly learned responsive units min, max and especially clamp. I was apple to apply clamp on the mobile view but it was trial and error.
I had to go back and change the hero section by removing the img on css and had to use background image for the picture to change during the responsiveness of the web.
